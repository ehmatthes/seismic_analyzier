Seismic analyzer
===

Exploratory project to determine if seismic activity can be used to identify more precise timing for known 
landslide events.

The initial data is on the order of 1GB for just a few events, so it's not committed to the repo yet. Data is 
available from 
[http://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/dataselect/docs/1/builder/](http://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/dataselect/docs/1/builder/). 
See [last 24 hours](https://earthquake.alaska.edu/partnerstations/SIT). Also see [station details](https://ds.iris.edu/mda/AT/SIT/).
